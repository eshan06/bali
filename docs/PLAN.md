# Bali v3 — build plan & live status

The one file every session reads (after ARCHITECTURE.md) and updates when it
finishes work. ARCHITECTURE.md says *how*; this file says *what* and *where we
are*. Update rules are at the bottom.

_Last updated: 2026-09-20 — exit demo wired for deployed environments (remote mode, real Cognito) and extended to assert live SSE delivery + self-expiry. The dev run itself is blocked on network egress — see **Now**._

## Now

- **Phase 2 is merged to `main`** (steps 1–8) — the walking skeleton is complete: session lifecycle over HTTP, events feed + SSE live grid, teacher portal, phone simulator.
- **Dev runs Phase 2** (2026-09-20): Railway auto-deploy repaired (the Railway
  GitHub App was never installed — it is now), environment renamed `dev`, and
  the sweep cron created: it POSTs `/internal/sweep` every minute and returns
  healthy. (The earlier "repoint the cron" note is settled; the Phase 1 path is
  kept as an alias, nothing 404s.)
- **Owner actions from the Phase 2 merge: done** — "Integration + race tests
  (real Postgres)" is now a required check, and the Claude workflows bill the
  owner's subscription (see decision log).
- **Outstanding Phase 2 item:** run the exit demo (phone simulator) against the
  Railway **dev** environment. The simulator is now *able* to: `DEMO_API_URL=…`
  runs every incident against a deployed API with real Cognito sign-ins
  (README, "Running it against a deployed API"). Verified end-to-end against a
  real listening server; not yet run against dev itself.
- **⛔ Blocked — owner action (network egress).** Cloud sessions cannot reach
  Railway at all: every `*.railway.app` / `*.railway.com` host is refused by the
  environment's egress policy (`403` to the proxy `CONNECT`), including the dev
  API and `backboard.railway.app`, so neither the demo nor a read of the service
  variables is possible from a session. `RAILWAY_TOKEN` and `DEV_API_URL` *are*
  set, so only the allowlist is missing. **To unblock:** add the dev API host and
  `backboard.railway.app` to the environment's network-egress allowlist
  (Claude Code → the environment's settings → network access), then re-run.
  AWS Cognito (`cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`) and GitHub are already
  reachable; `bali-dev.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com` is not, though the demo
  does not need it.
- **Also needed before the dev run (AWS, one-time):** five test users in the dev
  pool with permanent passwords, `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` on the app client,
  and the teacher's role flip. The demo names whichever is missing; the README
  lists all three.
- **Next up:** exit demo vs dev (once unblocked) → retroactive audit of pre-gates
  Phase 1 code → start Phase 3 (iOS student app).

## Phases

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | iOS enforcement spike | ✅ NFC → shields <1s proven on device. ⚠️ Still to confirm before Phase 3 step 5: DeviceActivity extension fires at interval END with the app force-quit. |
| 1 | The spine: monorepo, CI, schema + constraints, transition engine, Cognito auth, `/v1/me`, `/v1/taps`, session start, armed taps, Railway dev deploy | ✅ on `main` |
| 2 | Walking skeleton: real-Postgres CI lane + race tests, unlock recorded-with-a-note contract, enrollments, classes/blocks, session lifecycle + silence events, events feed + SSE (LISTEN/NOTIFY), teacher portal + live grid, phone simulator | ✅ merged to `main` · ⏳ dev exit demo (simulator ready; **blocked on egress allowlist** — see Now) |
| 3 | iOS student app: BaliCore (contract fixtures TS↔Swift), GRDB outbox + sync engine, enforcement (shields + DeviceActivity extension), Cognito PKCE auth, screens, device test gate (ISSUES #2 on hardware) | ⬜ next — 10 steps, plan agreed with owner |
| 4 | Reports + recap, rate limiting (ISSUES #1 per-account budgets), school-behind-one-IP load gate (k6), OpenAPI snapshot check | ⬜ |
| 5 | Pilot readiness: prod environment, monitoring/Sentry, backup restore drill, Vercel flip (portal + marketing), TestFlight, App Store submission, teacher invite gating docs | ⬜ |

## Go-live features

### In scope for launch (phase noted)

| Feature | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Core loop: tap→shield offline, armed taps, live grid, unlock always-recorded, refocus, join codes, roster, removal, self-expiry | 1–2 | ✅ built |
| 30s check-in that verifies shields before claiming them | 3 | rule 3 |
| Shields survive force-quit; bell frees phone via extension | 3 | pending spike confirmation |
| Onboarding: privacy contract → sign-in → Screen Time grant → allow-list | 3 | |
| Consent preview before joining a class | 3 | small |
| Unlock with optional, skippable reason (bathroom/nurse/other) | 3 | replaces full "passes" at launch |
| Custom shield screen ("Focused with Bali until 9:42") | 3 | bundle ID in entitlement request |
| Minimal student personal history + edit own name | 3 | backs the privacy contract |
| Sign in with Apple (App Review guideline 4.8) | 5 | Cognito IdP |
| End-of-session recap card (portal) | 4 | |
| Reports: class focus minutes + unlock list; aggregates only, never rankings | 4 | |
| Teacher signup gating (invite code) | 4 | today: manual role flip |
| Block provisioning: pre-written tags + portal register-by-ID fallback | 5 | no teacher iOS app at launch |
| Privacy policy, terms, pilot agreement, support/FAQ page | 5 | policy work, launch-blocking |

### Out at launch (fast-follow order)

Passes as a real state → QR join → teacher push notification on unlock →
lock-screen Live Activity → teacher iOS app → auto-start at bell / bell
schedules → weekly summary email → admin portal / multi-school self-serve →
substitute-day link → parent links (cut in v3) → solo focus → VPN enforcement
layer → roster import (CSV / Google Classroom).

### Open product decisions (owner to confirm; lean in parentheses)

1. Bathroom breaks: unlock-with-reason at launch vs real passes (lean: reasons).
2. Custom shield screen in launch scope (lean: in).
3. Minimal student history in launch scope (lean: in).
4. Under-13: pilot with 13+ classes only at launch (lean: yes).
5. Recap card in Phase 4 (lean: yes).

Parked by design, blocking before real students: data-deletion policy,
under-13 parental-consent machinery.

## External / waiting

- **Family Controls distribution entitlement** (Apple) — applied for; blocks
  TestFlight/App Store, not development builds. Bundle IDs incl. monitor
  extension (and shield-UI extension) should be in the request.
- Apple checklist: bundle IDs registered, App Store Connect record created.

## Decision log

- **2026-09-20** — The exit demo runs in two worlds behind one seam
  (`apps/api/scripts/demo/world.ts`): in-process (default — server, Postgres and
  issuer all local, time compressed by backdating rows) and remote
  (`DEMO_API_URL` — a deployed API with real Cognito sign-ins). Remote mode does
  **not** get a database handle, and deliberately: with no way to backdate, the
  silence and expiry incidents wait out the real threshold and the deployment's
  own cron, which is what makes a dev run evidence about the deployment rather
  than about the script. The other phones keep heartbeating through those waits,
  so "Ben went quiet" stays about Ben. Cost: a remote run takes minutes where a
  local one takes seconds; `npm run demo` is unchanged and still needs nothing.
- **2026-09-20** — The demo now asserts two guarantees it previously only
  implied: that events reach the teacher's grid **live over SSE** (the stream is
  opened before the incidents, and every event written afterwards must arrive on
  it), and that a session **expires by itself** — the sweep ends it, the grid
  learns live, participations close, and the phone reconciles on its next
  check-in. Both were named Phase 2 exit criteria with no assertion behind them.
- **2026-09-20** — Web sessions install dependencies via a repo-tracked
  SessionStart hook (`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`), not the cloud
  environment's setup-script field (it ran outside the repo root and broke
  every web session at startup; the field stays empty). Tracked hook means
  checking out a branch runs that branch's hook — accepted for a
  single-owner repo; revisit before adding outside contributors.
- **2026-09-20** — CI reviewer billing: Claude Review and `@claude` authenticate
  with the owner's Max subscription (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`), replacing
  prepaid API credits; reviewer model unchanged. The token also lives in the
  Dependabot secrets store, since GitHub withholds Actions secrets from
  Dependabot-triggered workflows.
- **2026-09-20** — Dependabot policy: alerts and security PRs stay on. The plan
  backstop exempts Dependabot's manifest-only PRs (author and content both
  checked); patch/minor bumps get auto-merge armed
  automatically (merge still requires every required check green); majors are
  handled deliberately by a session. First case: postcss's high-severity alert
  is fixed by a root npm override to `^8.5.23` instead of riding Dependabot's
  Next 15→16 major (#8); the override retires when Next 16 lands as its own
  task.
- **2026-09-20** — `last_seen_at` is stamped with the server's clock, not the
  device's clamped timestamp. The clamp orders events; liveness is an
  observation the server makes. Keying silence off the device's claim let a
  phone with a fast clock pin `last_seen_at` to `ends_at` and stay green for the
  rest of the lesson (rule 3's v2 bug), and a slow one flap the episode open and
  shut against decision 7's "exactly once".
- **2026-09-20** — An `event_id` identifies one event, checked at `insertEvent`.
  Reusing an id for a *different* event is a client bug, not a replay: treating
  it as one silently dropped the write, and on the unlock path 'replay' is a
  recorded outcome, so the phone would delete a record the server never stored —
  v2's lost-unlock bug through a different door. It is now `EVENT_ID_CONFLICT` →
  409, which the unlock contract reads as "keep the record, retry, surface".
- **2026-09-20** — Emergency unlock gets the one authorization check the rule
  allows. `POST /v1/sessions/:id/unlock` previously accepted any valid token for
  any session id, so a stranger could write permanent rows into another
  teacher's history and live grid. A refusal is still forbidden (the phone would
  read it as "discard"), so a caller with no participation row in the session
  *and* no active enrollment in its class now records as an orphan
  (`recorded_as: 'not_enrolled'`, no session/class attached, the claimed id in
  the payload) — durable, but unattached. A student removed mid-session keeps
  their ended participation row, so ISSUES #2's actual case is unchanged.
- **2026-09-20** — `extendSession`'s idempotency key is checked ahead of the
  ended-session guard and scoped to this session's own `session_extended` rows.
  An id already spent on a different event is now a 409 rather than a reported
  "extended" for a write that never happened: `insertEvent` de-dupes on
  `event_id`, so carrying on would have moved the end time with no matching
  event row — the session and its history disagreeing.
- **2026-09-20** — `POST /v1/classes` ships without an idempotency key: a lost
  response that the client retries leaves two identically named classes with
  different join codes. Accepted for now because it is visible and correctable
  by the teacher, and because classes do not pass through the event log, so the
  fix needs its own mechanism rather than an `event_id`. Tracked here; it lands
  with the portal work that actually calls it.
- **2026-09-20** — Portal auth ships access-token-only for the Phase 2 skeleton:
  no refresh token is requested or stored, so a teacher is signed out when the
  ~1h Cognito access token expires. Deliberate for the walking skeleton and
  written down rather than silently omitted; token renewal lands with the real
  portal UI (ARCHITECTURE.md auth decision 2 assumes it).
- **2026-09-20** — Bali Design System created at [Bali Design System](https://claude.ai/artifact/UPEBLz6nAmGXrzYnQ75qVz)
  (tokens, brand book, reference screens); UI work designs against it.
- **2026-09-19** — Plan-then-go (no plan-approval gate) and no-Claude-attribution
  adopted as standing rules; ecc `/plan` and `/santa-loop` ported as the loop's
  planner and verifier.
- **2026-09-19** — Quality gates: `main` protected (PRs only, no human-approval
  requirement while the team is 1), Claude Review is a required blocking check
  (Opus), "Plan doc updated" backstop with `[no-plan]` escape, tests required
  with every code change. CodeRabbit et al. skipped (free tier doesn't review
  private repos).
- **2026-09-19** — Merge policy: auto-merge on green. Every PR gets auto-merge
  (squash) enabled at open; GitHub merges the moment all required checks pass.
- **2026-09-19** — OpenAPI snapshot check deferred to Phase 4 (needs
  `@fastify/swagger` wiring; avoid conflicting with the unmerged Phase 2 branch).
- Earlier design decisions live in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (dated inline).

## How to update this file (every session that changes code)

- Flip statuses, refresh **Now**, and re-date the header line.
- Built a new feature? Add a row under Go-live features with a one-line
  architecture note; if a design decision changed, ARCHITECTURE.md is updated
  too.
- Keep it scannable — statuses and one-liners, not essays. History belongs in
  git; this file is the current truth.
